# Task App - Clean Updated

This is a ready-to-run Task Manager (SolidJS frontend + Node/Express backend) with plain CSS UI,
search & filters, and an in-memory fallback if MongoDB isn't configured.

## Quick start
1. Install concurrently globally or let npm install it for you.
2. Run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the server on port 5000 and client on port 3000.

Server API: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
Client: http://localhost:3000

Set `server/.env` with `MONGODB_URI` to persist data.
